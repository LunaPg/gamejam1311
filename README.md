Alchemystery
===

Alchemystery is an indy game developped for [GAMERella](http://tag.hexagram.ca/events/gamerella/).
This event was a hackaton-style gathering of nerds like us, where people were expected to create video games based on the theme "Alchemy" within two days.

- Buy materials from the Shop makes it easier to experiment.
- Unlock achievements related to your experimentations.

Technical note

Part of the challenge (that we imposed to ourselves) was to use standard web technologies like Backbone, RequireJS, jQuery, bootstrap, etc.
This means no fancy canvas and no physics engine... but we're compatible with phones, tablets and desktop browsers !
